# Problem Statement

* There are a lot of customer on a company's InvestorAI platform. Whenever they login in their app and view anything, they get pings from their mobile phone indicating that the customers are using the app. 
* Provided with 4 weeks of [sample data](https://github.com/AparGarg99/App_Usage_Prediction/tree/master/data) : 3 weeks of training data and 1 week of test data. 
* Training data contains id, gender, age, number of kids the customer has and all the pings that have been received (during the training data period). 
* The task is to predict how many hours the customer will be online / using our app on a given day. So the test data contains customer id, and date (during the test data period).
* The test data also contains the actual online hours, which is what your model should predict. 
* Root Mean Squared Error or RMSE should be the metric for evaluation.
