# Problem Statement 🤔🤯

* There are a lot of customers on BiosectRx's platform. Whenever they login into the app and view anything, the company gets pings from their mobile phone indicating that they are using the app.
* Provided with 4 weeks of [sample data](https://github.com/AparGarg99/App_Usage_Prediction/tree/master/data) : 3 weeks of training data and 1 week of test data. 
* Training data contains id, gender, age, number of kids the customer has and all the pings that have been received (during the training data period). 
* The task is to predict how many hours the customers will be online/using the app on a given day. 
* So the test data contains customer id, and date (during the test data period). The test data also contains the actual online hours, which is what the model should predict.
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) must be the metric for evaluation.
